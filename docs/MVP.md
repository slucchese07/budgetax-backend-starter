# MVP Scope – Budgeting + Deductions App

## Personas
- **Young worker/student** (individual tax return, wants simple deductions).
- **Freelancer/sole trader** (more categories, assets, car logbook).

## Core Flows
1. **Import transactions** (CSV now; bank APIs later) → auto-categorise → mark deductible.
2. **Receipt capture** (later) → OCR → match to transaction.
3. **Assets** → add equipment/vehicle → auto-depreciation schedule.
4. **Tax summary** → FY totals by ATO-like labels → export CSV/PDF for accountant.
